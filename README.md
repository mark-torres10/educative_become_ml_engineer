# Educative's "Becoming a Machine Learning Engineer" Track

Here, I track my progress through Educative's "Becoming a Machine Learning Engineer" Track (see https://www.educative.io/track/become-ml-engineer), with 5 associated courses:

1. Machine Learning for Software Engineers
2. Image Recognition with Machine Learning
3. Natural Language Processing with Machine Learning
4. Applied Machine Learning: Deep Learning for Industry
5. Applied Machine Learning: Industry Case Study with Tensorflow

Each of the folders in this repo contains Jupyter notebooks that contain my notes from this class
